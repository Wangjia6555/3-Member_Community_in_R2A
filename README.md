# 3-Member_Community_in_R2A
Three bacterial strains were co-cultured as a community with various initial inoculum ratios, and their growth was simulated by COMETS dFBA modeling. The COMETS dFBA was also simulated for each community member as individual culture.
Explanation of the numbers in file name: 
R3C_ReSeq_Case10_0.098-10-0.255_1000-1-1000_DefVmax10_P0-6_FitqPCR_pFBA_Initial3.9E-7_21AA_R2A004Gapfilled_CellWeight3.9.py
R3C means 3-member community in R2A medium. 
0.098-10-0.255, 0.098 is the uptake rate of glucose and amino acids in strain YR343, 10 is the uptake rate of glucose and amino acids in strain GM17, and 0.255 is the uptake rate of glucose and amino acids in strain AP49.
1000-1-1000 means the initial inoculum ratio is YR343-GM17-AP49 1000-1-1000, which is the same to GM17-YR343-AP49 = 0.001-1-1
